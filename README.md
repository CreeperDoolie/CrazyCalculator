# Crazy Calculator
This is a calculator I programmed for a class in basic python.

When you launch crazycalculator.py, it will show a intro panel that says the name of the calculator, "Crazy Calculator", and "By: CreeperDoolie". Right after that loads, a promt will appear asking for a operator Ex:) +,-,*,/.

The program will then ask you to input two numbers and add, subtract, multiply, or divide those numbers and output your equation result

Example:)

                    By: CreeperDoolie                     
---------------------------------------------------------

Enter an operator (+,-,*,/): -

Enter your first number: 15

Enter your second number: 7

15 - 7 = 8

The program will then ask you if you want to input another equation and will loop the process.

Example:) if you want to input another equation

Would you like to enter another equation? (y/n): y

Enter an operator (+,-,*,/): 

Example:) if you dont want to input another equation

Would you like to enter another equation? (y/n): n

Thank you for using Crazy Calculator!
